Project:

I've attached the word document 'Projects 2020 (HW5).docx' in my repo. I've placed my name next to the projects I'm interested in working on, and I added a project idea involving Bluetooth footage transfer from a camera to a smartphone. Note that Neil Roy is my project partner, so we will work together.


Make:

I copied the "make" directory from the provided "exercises" repo and modified the script to generate .o files from .c files, then compiled those .o files into .arm files (using user-defined and built-in variables).
To compile, simply type "make" or "make all" in the command line. To remove the compiled files, run "make clean". To get more information about the variables used, type "make test". Once the files are compiled, run "app.arm" to print "Hello World" into the command line.


Cross-Compiling:
